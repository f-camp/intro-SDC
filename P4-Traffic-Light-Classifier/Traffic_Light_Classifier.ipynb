    "# Traffic Light Classifier\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you’ll use your knowledge of computer vision techniques to build a classifier for images of traffic lights! You'll be given a dataset of traffic light images in which one of three lights is illuminated: red, yellow, or green.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll pre-process these images, extract features that will help us distinguish the different types of images, and use those features to classify the traffic light images into three classes: red, yellow, or green. The tasks will be broken down into a few sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading and visualizing the data**. \n",
    "      The first step in any classification task is to be familiar with your data; you'll need to load in the images of traffic lights and visualize them!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pre-processing**. \n",
    "    The input images and output labels need to be standardized. This way, you can analyze all the input images using the same classification pipeline, and you know what output to expect when you eventually classify a *new* image.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Feature extraction**. \n",
    "    Next, you'll extract some features from each image that will help distinguish and eventually classify these images.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Classification and visualizing error**. \n",
    "    Finally, you'll write one function that uses your features to classify *any* traffic light image. This function will take in an image and output a label. You'll also be given code to determine the accuracy of your classification model.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Evaluate your model**.\n",
    "    To pass this project, your classifier must be >90% accurate and never classify any red lights as green; it's likely that you'll need to improve the accuracy of your classifier by changing existing features or adding new features. I'd also encourage you to try to get as close to 100% accuracy as possible!\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here are some sample images from the dataset (from left to right: red, green, and yellow traffic lights):\n",

    "This means that every input image should be in the same format, of the same size, and so on. We'll be creating features by performing the same analysis on every picture, and for a classification task like this, it's important that **similar images create similar features**! \n",

    "We also need the output to be a label that is easy to read and easy to compare with other labels. It is good practice to convert categorical data like \"red\" and \"green\" to numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common classification output is a 1D list that is the length of the number of classes - three in the case of red, yellow, and green lights - with the values 0 or 1 indicating which class a certain image is. For example, since we have three classes (red, yellow, and green), we can make a list with the order: [red value, yellow value, green value]. In general, order does not matter, we choose the order [red value, yellow value, green value] in this case to reflect the position of each light in descending vertical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "A red light should have the  label: [1, 0, 0]. Yellow should be: [0, 1, 0]. Green should be: [0, 0, 1]. These labels are called **one-hot encoded labels**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: one-hot encoding will be especially important when you work with [machine learning algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-one-hot-encode-sequence-data-in-python/)).*\n",
